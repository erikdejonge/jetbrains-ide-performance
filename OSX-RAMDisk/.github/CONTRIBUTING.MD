General guides
==============
There is no point forking repo and making your changes in your own for and forgeting about them.
This small app can benefit from your contribution, so, please make PRs, I will accept them as my time permits (1,2 days).

If you have enough time and resources, it would be great to wrap this app and place into brew, there is a branch in the repo for it.

Code changes
============
vim or emacs is the best tool to code for this repo.
If you made changes to the file, please use vim commands `gg=G` to format the code. This will make it consistent.

Thank you for your contribution!
